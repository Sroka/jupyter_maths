    \section{Vectors}

    Every vector has a:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Magnitude - that is just length and is obtainable by using pythagorean theorem on all components
        \item Unit vector - (Denoted as $\vu{A}$)that is a vector with the same direction as the original vector but of the magnitude 1. To obtain it you have to divide every component by the magnitude of the original vector
    \end{itemize}

    \section{Dot product}

    A way of multiplying two vectors to get a \textbf{scalar}
    \[\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B}=\sum{a_ib_i}=\cancel{a_1b_1}+a_2b_2+a_3b_3+\dots\]
    What is it good for? It gives us info about lengths and angles because (this can also be quite a good proof for lat of cosines) It is called dot product because the symbol used for it is a dot! Because the result is a scalar it is also called scalar product:
    \[\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B}=\abs*{\vec{A}}\abs*{\vec{B}}\cos{\theta}\]

    \begin{problem}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[a)]Compute $\bmqty{1 & 2 & -4}\cdot\bmqty{2 & 3 & 5}$
            \[
                \bmqty{1 & 2 & -4}\cdot\bmqty{2 & 3 & 5}=2+6-20=-12
            \]
            \item[b)] Is the angle between these two vectors acute, obtuse or right?\\
            The dot product is negative so $\cos{\theta}<$ and that means that $\theta > \frac{\pi}{2}$. The angle is obtuse
        \end{itemize}
    \end{problem}

    \begin{problem}
        Suppose $B=\bmqty{2 & 2 & 1}$. Suppose also that B makes an angle of $\ang{30}$ with A and $A\cdot B=6$. Find $\abs{A}.$\\
        \begin{align}
            \sqrt{4 + 4 +1}\cdot\abs{A}\cos{\ang{30}}=6\\
            \abs{A}=\frac{6\cdot2}{3\cdot\sqrt{3}}=\frac{4}{\sqrt{3}}
        \end{align}
    \end{problem}

    \begin{problem}
        If $A\cdotB=0$ what is the angle between A and B?\\
        The angle is right or magnitudes of one or both vectors are zero
    \end{problem}
